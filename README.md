# BLE_HRM_Client_Example
Arduino Nano33 BLE Heart Rate Client '180d' Example.

After struggling to find information on how to connect my heart rate monitor (Garmin Fenix 6pro) to my Arduino Nano33, and eventually managing to do it I have decided to create an example project to hopefully help someone else.

The code will not be a complete program, but will work enough for someone to get started on their own, without days and days of headbanging!

I will update the README as I progress.
